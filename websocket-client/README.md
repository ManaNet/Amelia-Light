The websocket client for Amelia which handles the processing and checking from the ScribbleHub server. (This is a customized version for the webserver which
is incredibly lighter than the full version).

## üí¨ Setting up Amelia Websocket.
Amelia Websocket, which is a new addition implemented on Amelia 2.0, is a separate process of Amelia which can be said as the heart or the brain
of the Discord bot. The websocket handles the checking for updates on RSS Feeds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation of Amelia Websocket.
To install the websocket, you need to download the websocket jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/ManaNet/Amelia/releases) and then setup the following
environment variables.
```
amelia_auth=AUTHENTICATION
amelia_db=mongodb://user:pass@ip:port
amelia_url=url to webserver.
```

After the environment variables are set, you can now start up the websocket with no configuration via: `java -jar Amelia-Websocket.jar`.

## üß∞ Build Yourself
To build this client, all you have to do is run the maven task:
```maven
mvn clean verify assembly:single
```

After which, you should see a `target` folder appearing with all the JARs (specifically get the one with `with-dependencies` as suffix).
